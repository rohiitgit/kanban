# Invite-Only System Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up and use the invite-only authentication system that has been integrated into your Kanban application.

## 🎯 What's Been Implemented

Your app now has an **invite-only** authentication system where:
- ✅ Only admins can invite new users
- ✅ Regular users cannot sign up without an invitation
- ✅ Google OAuth is still used, but requires an invitation first
- ✅ User roles (user/admin) are determined by the invitation
- ✅ Non-invited users are blocked at the OAuth callback

## 📋 Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Database Setup (Required)

**1. Run the database migrations in Supabase:**

Go to your Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor and run these files **in order**:

```sql
-- 1. First, run: supabase/migrations/001_create_profiles_table.sql
-- This creates the profiles table with RLS policies

-- 2. Then, run: supabase/migrations/002_create_invitations_table.sql
-- This creates the invitations table

-- 3. Finally, run: supabase/migrations/003_create_triggers.sql
-- This creates triggers to auto-create profiles when users sign up
```

**How to run:**
1. Open each `.sql` file
2. Copy the entire content
3. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
4. Click "Run"
5. Verify no errors appear

### Phase 2: Environment Variables (Required)

**Add your Service Role Key:**

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API
2. Copy the `service_role` key (⚠️ Keep this secret!)
3. Add to your `.env.local`:

```env
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...your-key-here
```

4. Restart your dev server: `npm run dev`

### Phase 3: Make Yourself the First Admin (Critical!)

**Run this SQL in Supabase to make your account an admin:**

```sql
-- Replace 'your-email@gmail.com' with your actual Google email
INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, email, role, status)
SELECT
  id,
  email,
  'admin',
  'active'
FROM auth.users
WHERE email = 'your-email@gmail.com'
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE
SET role = 'admin', status = 'active';
```

**Important:** This gives YOUR Google account admin privileges so you can invite others!

### Phase 4: Disable Public Signups in Supabase (Required)

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → **Authentication** → **Settings**
2. Scroll to **"User Signups"**
3. **Toggle OFF** "Enable email signups"
4. **Toggle OFF** "Enable phone signups"
5. Leave Google OAuth **enabled**
6. Click **Save**

This prevents anyone from signing up without an invitation!

## 🚀 How to Use the System

### As an Admin

**1. Invite a New User**

Option A: Using the API (for now, until UI is built):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/invite \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie" \
  -d '{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "role": "user",
    "message": "Welcome to the team!"
  }'
```

Option B: Build the admin UI (files provided but not yet integrated):
- `components/admin/InviteUserForm.tsx` - Ready to use
- Just import and add to your admin dashboard

**2. View All Invitations**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/invitations \
  -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie"
```

**3. Revoke an Invitation**

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/admin/invitations/{invitation-id} \
  -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie"
```

### As a New User

1. Admin sends you an invitation to your email
2. You receive an email from Supabase with a magic link
3. Click the link → redirected to Google OAuth
4. Sign in with Google
5. Your account is created with the role specified in the invitation
6. Access the appropriate dashboard (user or admin)

### As a Non-Invited User

1. Try to sign in with Google OAuth
2. OAuth completes successfully
3. Callback handler checks for invitation
4. **No invitation found** → Sign out + redirect to "Access Denied" page
5. Message explains: "Invitation Required"

---

## 🔒 Security Features

### What's Protected

✅ **Server-side verification** - Invitation check happens on the server (cannot be bypassed)
✅ **RLS policies** - Database enforces who can create/view invitations
✅ **Role enforcement** - Roles set by admin, not user-selectable
✅ **Status checks** - Inactive/suspended users blocked
✅ **OAuth + Invitations** - Both are required for access

### What Happens on Login

```
User clicks "Sign in with Google"
  ↓
Google OAuth (successful)
  ↓
Callback handler runs
  ↓
Check: Does user have a profile?
  ├─ NO → Check: Valid invitation exists?
  │   ├─ YES → Create profile (via trigger)
  │   └─ NO → Sign out + "Access Denied"
  └─ YES → Check: Status = active?
      ├─ YES → Redirect to dashboard
      └─ NO → Sign out + "Access Denied"
```

## 🧪 Testing the System

### Test 1: Admin Can Invite

1. Log in as admin (your account)
2. Call the invite API with a test email
3. Check the email inbox for invitation
4. Verify invitation appears in Supabase `invitations` table

### Test 2: Invited User Can Access

1. Have someone click the invitation link
2. They sign in with Google
3. They get redirected to the app
4. Their profile is created in `profiles` table
5. Invitation status changes to "accepted"

### Test 3: Non-Invited User is Blocked

1. Try logging in with a Google account that wasn't invited
2. Google OAuth succeeds
3. Callback handler checks for invitation
4. No invitation found → Redirected to "Access Denied"
5. User cannot access the app

### Test 4: Role-Based Access Works

1. Invite a user with role "user"
2. They log in → Redirected to `/user` dashboard
3. Try accessing `/admin` → Blocked by server-side layout
4. Invite another user with role "admin"
5. They log in → Can access `/admin`

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Service role key is missing"

**Fix:**
1. Get key from Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API
2. Add to `.env.local` as `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...`
3. Restart server: `npm run dev`

### "Cannot read profiles table"

**Fix:**
1. Run database migrations in order (001, 002, 003)
2. Verify tables exist in Supabase Table Editor
3. Check RLS policies are enabled

### "I'm not an admin"

**Fix:**
Run the SQL from Phase 3 with your actual email address to make yourself admin.

### "Invitation email not received"

**Fix:**
1. Check Supabase email settings (Authentication → Email Templates)
2. Verify SMTP is configured or use Supabase's default sender
3. Check spam folder
4. Test with a different email provider

### "Access Denied" even though I was invited

**Fix:**
1. Check `invitations` table - is your email there with status "pending"?
2. Check `profiles` table - does a profile exist for your user ID?
3. Run the trigger manually: Re-invite the user
4. Check browser console for errors
